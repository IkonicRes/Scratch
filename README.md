## Description
I wanted to make a progressive web application that allows the user to use a text editor either in the browser or offline/installed. It uses React and bundles all of my resource files automatically on build.

## Installation
run "npm run install", then "npm run start". This should install all dependencies and build before starting the server.

## Usage
Check out the application at its heroku deployment [HERE](https://scratch-bb4b4774f119.herokuapp.com/)  
To install the program to your desktop, hit the "Install" button in the top left corner.

Other than that, it is a fairly standard text editor.

## Contributing
Be good and do code.

## Testing
Use Jest or another test suite to test the app
